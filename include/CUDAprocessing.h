 * @brief Add a reference hologram to GPU memory for later reuse.
 *
 * Transfers a reference hologram (raw data) from host memory to GPU device memory.

 *                             Ordering: projection-major or as used by the rest of the pipeline
 *                             (typically: for each projection, a block of size _X*_Y is stored).
 * @param _X                   Number of pixels in X (detector width) per projection.
 * @param _Y                   Number of pixels in Y (detector height) per projection.
 * @param _nproj               Number of projection angles contained in the hologram dataset.
 * @param _NA                  Numerical aperture of the imaging objective used during acquisition.
 * @param lambda               Illumination wavelength (in micrometers).

 * @param _n_imm               Refractive index of the immersion medium.
 * @param _do_NNC              Flag controlling the sign:
 *                             - _do_NNC > 0 : apply **non-negativity** constraint (restrict values >= 0),
 *                             - _do_NNC < 0 : apply **non-positivity** constraint (restrict values <= 0),
 *                             - _do_NNC == 0: **no** non-negativity/non-positivity constraint applied.
 *                             This setting defines how the object refractive index is constrained
 *                             relative to the immersion medium.
 * @param _fftWindowsScale     Scaling factor applied to the FFT windowing during preprocessing.
 *
 * @return 0 on success; non-zero error code on failure (e.g., invalid parameters, insufficient GPU memory).
 *
 * @note The function stores the reference hologram on the GPU until HL00_removeReference() is called.
 *       Ensure that the memory layout of `hologram` matches the expectations of the rest of the pipeline.
 * @note If calling from MATLAB, convert data to int16 (short) using an appropriate conversion helper
 *       (e.g., convertIntMatrixForC). Be mindful of MATLAB column-major vs. C row-major ordering if applicable.

 *                              in the GP algorithm. Lower values yield smoother convergence
